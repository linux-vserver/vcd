VCD

BUGS:
- need to check start/reboot/stop with and without UNAMEs set (NODENAME, ...)
 -> should work with Gentoo's baselayout 1.12, needs fixing with 1.13
- vshelper checkup (wrt non-standard vdir etc. for example), cleanup ???
- better error messages (esp. on MEINVAL), check error handling in general

NEEDED FEATURES:
- disk limits implementation, important feature for hosting/reselling/etc. solutions
- onboot settings, to start VServers on VCD startup
- fix/cleanup mount (esp. wrt. vdir being a top-level mount point)
- debian/ dir, RPM .spec file, init scripts, distrib make targets, pathprog probably

WANTED FEATURES:
- extended vx.status method, possibly a big array with other important info such as
CPU, RAM, NPROC, etc. taken directly from the syscalls
- vx.move method to also move the VServer around on the disk
- sysctl support
- cpuset support
