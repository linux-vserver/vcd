VCD

BUGS:
- fastboot file needed for some distributions, suggested fix so far:
    put before 'switch(fork())' in vshelper_startup:
    char *fastboot = str_path_concat(vdir, "/fastboot"); close(open_trunc(fastboot));

NEEDED FEATURES:
- debian/ dir, RPM .spec file, init scripts (done for Gentoo!), distrib make targets, pathprog probably
- support _ and - in vserver names (needs a new string checking function in Lucid)

WANTED FEATURES:
- add vx.limits and vx.netload methods to get more info
- vx.move method to also move the VServer around on the disk
- sysctl support
- cpuset support
